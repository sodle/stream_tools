# Stream Tools

A library of active web widgets that can be used in any browser, but are
designed for streamers to use to decorate scenes with interesting displays.

Design aims:

- Flexible
- No coding required to modify appearance
- All active components are controlled/rendered by browser (no APIs needed!)

Tools:

- countdown: displays a themeable countdown to an arbitrary date and time
